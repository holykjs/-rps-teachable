# ðŸš€ Production Setup Complete

## Your Railway Server
**URL**: `https://rps-teachable-production.up.railway.app`

## âœ… Configuration Applied

### Client Configuration
- Updated `.env.production` with your Railway server URL
- TensorFlow.js dependency conflicts resolved
- Vercel deployment configuration ready

### Server Configuration  
- Production-ready with environment variables
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- CORS configured for production

## ðŸ”§ Railway Dashboard Setup

### Required Environment Variables
Go to your Railway dashboard and set these variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
```

**Replace `your-vercel-app.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel deployment URL once deployed.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Client to Vercel
```bash
# Your client is ready to deploy
npm run build  # Test locally first
# Then deploy to Vercel
```

### 2. Update CORS After Client Deployment
Once your client is deployed to Vercel (e.g., `my-rps-game.vercel.app`), update Railway environment:

```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://my-rps-game.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Setup

### Test Server Health
Visit: `https://rps-teachable-production.up.railway.app/health`
Expected response: `{"status":"ok","rooms":0,"players":0}`

### Test Complete Flow
1. Deploy client to Vercel
2. Update Railway CORS with client URL  
3. Test single player mode (should work immediately)
4. Test multiplayer mode (should connect to Railway server)

## ðŸŽ® Features Ready for Production

âœ… **Single Player**: AI gesture recognition  
âœ… **Multiplayer**: Dual webcam with WebRTC  
âœ… **Real-time**: Socket.IO communication  
âœ… **Scalable**: Railway auto-scaling  
âœ… **Secure**: Environment-based CORS  

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **HTTPS Required**: WebRTC requires HTTPS in production (Railway provides this)
2. **Camera Permissions**: Users must allow camera access
3. **CORS**: Must update Railway CORS after client deployment
4. **WebRTC**: May need STUN/TURN servers for some networks

Your multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game is now production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
